- **Calorie Calculation**: Calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation.
- **Activity Multiplier**: Adjusts the BMR based on the user's activity level to determine maintenance calories.

- **Output**: Provides the total daily calories needed to achieve the desired surplus.
